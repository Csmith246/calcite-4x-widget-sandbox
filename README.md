# Repo Info
The purpose of this repo is to provide a place where Calcite Components can be tested within a JS API 4.x Widget context. It's been observed that Calcite Components sometimes behave differently when used in straight HTML versus when used in JSX. This repo will help with testing and isolating instances of those differences in Calcite behavior.
